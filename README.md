# Be in Times 2024: Operational Efficiency Improvement for Metall-Group JSC

**4th place** at Be in Times 2024 Case Championship (ESTIEM × Kept Engineering)  
**Team**: aCUtone!  
**Timeline**: Nov 18–24 (online round), Dec 6 (final pitch @ Kept office, Moscow)

---

## Challenge

Develop a comprehensive strategy to enhance operational efficiency for a metallurgical company through process optimization, cost reduction, and digital transformation initiatives.

---

## Solution

Our team proposed a **three-component roadmap** for production digitalization:

### 1. MES (Manufacturing Execution System)
- Real-time monitoring of production lines
- Equipment load control and schedule optimization
- Integration with quality management systems

### 2. ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)
- Centralized procurement, warehouse, and financial management
- Automated demand planning and forecasting
- Cross-departmental business process synchronization

### 3. IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things)
- Sensor network for equipment condition monitoring
- **Predictive Maintenance**: failure prediction analytics
- **Quality Control**: automated defect detection

---

## Economic Impact

- **Equipment downtime reduction**: −20–25%
- **Defect rate decrease**: −15–20%
- **Total savings**: up to ₽13.3B in the long term
- **Payback period**: 2–3 years

> Detailed financial analysis (NPV, IRR, sensitivity) is available in the [presentation](/kept_presentation.pdf).

## My Contribution

- **Business analysis**: researched metallurgical industry challenges (defects, energy costs, labor shortages), identified critical pain points
- **Solution benchmarking**: analyzed MES/ERP implementation cases at ArcelorMittal, Wonderware, SAP; selected optimal technology stack
- **Unit economics modeling**: calculated implementation costs vs. impact (ROI, payback period, scenario sensitivity)
- **Pitch structure**: developed presentation logic (problem → solution → roadmap → impact) and roadmap visualization

---

## Result

- Advanced to **finals** (top-8 teams out of 30+ participants)
- **4th place** following on-site pitch defense at Kept Engineering office (Moscow, December 6, 2024)

---

## Tech Stack & Tools

- **Analytics**: MS Excel, financial modeling (NPV, IRR)
- **Visualization**: MS PowerPoint, Miro (for roadmap and architecture diagrams)
- **Domain**: Operations Management, Industry 4.0, Change Management
